# nav_and_whimsy

The goal of nav_and_whimsy is to be a 3D kinematic movement and localization simulation.
It is in development, and not ready for use. To use, clone and use ./run.sh to run.
Key dependencies include an up-to-date version of the Rust package manager 'cargo',
as well as 'numpy' and 'scipy'.

The following is a graph of the 3D implementation, with full kinematic implementation.
The control system is implemented using virtual spring-mass-damper systems based on the
difference between existing and desired states. These produce three acceleration values
(like those that could be generated by a motor or thruster being activated) for up/down,
yaw direction changes, and forward/backward thrust, which are then numerically integrated
to provide velocity and position values in the three dimensional space, as can be seen
in the figure below.

Here, starting from the origin at (0,0,0), the object is directed to move to the following
points: ( 1.0,  1.0,  1.0)
        (-1.0,  4.0, -2.0)
        ( 1.0,  3.0,  3.0)
A point is considered hit when the radial distance betweeen the object's current location and
the desired position is less than 0.1 meters.

the documentation, which is written in markdown using GitBook.


Note: Less whimsical than desired.
