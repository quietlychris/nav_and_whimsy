# nav_and_whimsy

The goal of Nav_and_Whimsy is a 3D kinematic movement and localization simulation.
It is in development, and not ready for use. To use, clone and use ./run.sh to run.
Key dependencies include an up-to-date version of the Rust package manager 'cargo',
as well as 'numpy' and 'scipy'.

For more documentation, and updates on the development, please refer to
the documentation, which is written in Markdown for GitBook. 

Important note: Less whimsical than desired.
