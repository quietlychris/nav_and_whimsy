# nav_and_whimsy

The goal of nav_and_whimsy is to be a 3D kinematic movement and localization simulation.
It is in development, and not ready for use. To use, clone and use ./run.sh to run.
Key dependencies include an up-to-date version of the Rust package manager _cargo_,
as well as _numpy_ and _scipy_.

The following is a graph of the 3D implementation, with full kinematic implementation.
The control system is implemented using virtual spring-mass-damper systems based on the
difference between existing and desired states. These produce three acceleration values
(like those that could be generated by a motor or thruster being activated) for up/down,
yaw direction changes, and forward/backward thrust, which are then numerically integrated
to provide velocity and position values in the three dimensional space, as can be seen
in the figure below.

Here, starting from the origin at (0,0,0), the object is directed to move search each point
in a grid that is 7m x 7m x 2 m, where a point is located at each integer position. A point
is considered hit when the radial distance betweeen the object's current location and the
desired position is less than 0.1 meters.

the _documentation_ directory, which is written in markdown using GitBook.


Note: Less whimsical than desired.
