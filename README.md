# nav_and_whimsy

The goal of nav_and_whimsy is to be a 6D kinematic movement and localization simulation.
It is in development, unstable, and likely not ready for use. To use, clone into a local repository
and use ./run.sh to run.

### Dependencies
This simulation is primarily written in Rust, and requires the latest stable version (several of
the features included in Rust 2018 are used). The most recent developments were tested using
rustc version 1.34 stable. In addition, some of the post-processing requires the `numpy` and
`scipy` Python libraries, primarily for data visualiation. However, the log files are written
into `.csv` form, so those steps may be run separately if desired. The documenation is written
using `mdbook`, and can be installed using `$ cargo install mdbook` and built locally using
`$ mdbook serve`. 

The following is a graph of the 3D implementation, with full kinematic implementation.
The demonstrated control system is implemented using virtual spring-mass-damper systems based on
the difference between existing and desired states. These produce three acceleration values
(like those that could be generated by a motor or thruster being activated) for up/down,
yaw direction changes, and forward/backward thrust, which are then numerically integrated
to provide velocity and position values in the three dimensional space, as can be seen
in the figure below.

Here, starting from the origin at (0,0,0), the object is directed to move search each point
in a grid that is 7m x 7m x 2 m, where a point is located at each integer position. A point
is considered hit when the radial distance betweeen the object's current location and the
desired position is less than 0.1 meters.

the `documentation/` directory, which is written in markdown using `mdbook`.
