# Introduction to Nav_and_Whimsy

Welcome! This is the documentation for the `nav_and_whimsy` project'. Before getting started, please note the following:
- **This project is unstable.** Things are broken and seriously changed about
  every time they're touched.
- This project is both meant as both a meaningful simulation as well as an educational exercise for myself. As a result, most of this project is written using only the standard library (at least for the moment), hopes to keep dependencies on external crates to a minimum. However, it is possible that some will be used in the future for functions like linear algebra, etc.
- The documentation is also open to change. The primary structure is to have    general project stuff, but also to have work logs and notes and things   available to anyone that wants to read them. The code itself should have TO_DO's for future work, be both clearly written as code and have comments that make it easy to understand.

Please feel free to make any pull requests, or send me a message, or something. I'm happy to hear comments or constructive criticisms. Thank you!
