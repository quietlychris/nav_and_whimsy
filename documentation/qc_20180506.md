First work log. Obviously, the commit log can be viewed to see actual changes,
but there's a few major things from today.
- First, an effort to validate the functionality of the core components has been
  started, in the form of a test module. Tests should be written for functions
  moving forward.
- Documentation has been more meaningfully begun, and additions are expected to
  be more regular, although as always, it's likely to a "time will tell" sort of
  thing
- Stability of a 3D locus has been generally achieve (but is NOT yet extremely
  resilient), and is consistently displaying overdamped behavior that makes
  actually passing through the waypoints to achieve 'searched' status difficult
- The formerly usize-based array has been replaced by a Point-struct based
  vector of arbitrary length and population. This should be more useful for
  specifying search methods in the future
