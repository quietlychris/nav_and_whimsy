3D works! The errors that we were getting earlier regarding movement in the z-axis have been
figured out. It turns out it wasn't an issue with get_z_acceleration acceleration at all;
instead, it was a control logic error; since z acceleration wasn't getting updated in all
states, it was possible for an acceleration value to get stuck high, resulting in unexpected
motion in that DoF. By making sure that zvardd is always being updated, we hvae gotten that
under control.

Furthermore, a couple of tests got written to help the development process. They are basically
minimum viable test cases for both time-based and grid-search based approaches, and are really
just available to help investigate certain types of behavior without changing main() around too
much.
