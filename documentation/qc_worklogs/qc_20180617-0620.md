Still working on unit test for trend_speed_towards_zero().

Got trend_speed_towards_zero() working in 2D, added a State::print() function. I don't think
that I'm going to add a unit test for that one, though, since it's only a display function, and
since it can only reference the State (it's &self, not &mut self), which should make it safeish. Maybe
if I get bored, but that's pretty low priority.

Next steps: figure out motion with the zaxis, because it looks like something's wrong there.

It's days like this I'm glad I'm writing this worklog. I would have had to spend at least 20 minutes
examining my work from yesterday to remember what I actually did. To start, I've got the basics of 3D
motion working. However, it looks like something's not working when the desired points are directly
above (soon be checked for below) my current position. So if I'm at the origin, and I want to move to
(0,0,1), my behavior doesn't do what I think it should; I'm currently working on solving this, which
I think will often have to do with the get_z_acceleration() function. A unit test for that will
probably need to be written. In the mean time, however, I'm going to commit the basics of the 3D stuff,
since points that don't fit that above/below criteria actually seem to be doing okay.
